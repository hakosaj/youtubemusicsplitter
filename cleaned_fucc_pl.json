Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A&M Records, in 1988), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized \"grunge\" in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam.\r\n\r\nCurrent Members:\r\nChris Cornell (Vocal)\r\nKim Thayil (Lead Guitar)\r\nMatt Cameron (Bass)\r\nBen Shepherd (Drum)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.soundgardenworld.com/",

Comprised of Sam Getz (guitar/vocals), Brett Lindemann (keys), Jimmy Weaver (bass), Mikey Gould (drums) and Bri and Jon Bryant (bgv\u2019s), Cleveland-based WELSHLY ARMS pays homage to many of their collective musical influences such as Jimi Hendrix, The Temptations, Otis Redding, and Howlin Wolf.\n\nThe power of their live show has quickly built them a dedicated following in Ohio and has set the stage for things to tip into a national following in 2016 with performances confirmed on/at The Rock Boat, SXSW, Summerfest, Austin City Limits, Laurel Live, the San Diego County Fair and more. Within the last year alone, their music has been featured in the movie trailer for the Jack Black Film \u201cThe D Train,\u201d a national TV/radio campaign for the Cleveland Indians, the promo for the new Netflix show Sense8 and the movie trailer for the new Quentin Tarantino movie, Hateful Eight. \n\nIn August of 2016, WELSHLY ARMS will embark on The Tour De Compadres, supporting NEEDTOBREATHE and Mat Kearney on a 53 date tour across the US, hitting iconic venues such as Red Rocks and The Greek Theatre.\n\n____________________________\n____________________________\n\n\"Legendary\" Lyrics:\n\nTake a look around me\nTaking pages from a magazine\nBeen looking for the answers \nEver since we were seventeen\n\nYou know the truth can be a weapon \nTo fight this world of ill intentions \nA new answer to the same question \nHow many times will you learn the same lesson?\n\nI think they got it all wrong \nWe just gotta hold on \nAnd on and on and on \n\n'Cause we're gonna be legends \nGonna get their attention\nWhat we're doing here ain't just scary\nIt's about to be legendary\n\nYea we're gonna be legends \nGonna teach 'em all a lesson\nGot this feeling in our souls we carry \nThat it's about to be legendary\n\nThis is what we came for\nAnd we couldn't want it anymore\nWe can never turn back now\nGot to leave it all on the floor\n\nBeen dreaming of the payoff \nThough the struggles and the trade-offs \nFighting tooth and nail on the way up\nTell them the truth but they'd think it's just made up\n\nEventually they're gonna know who's right\nTo make a stand you've got to win the fight \nCan't stand the heat then just stay out the light \nOr you might never make it out alive\nYou gotta live without a compromise \nLet everybody hear your battle cry!",

        "description": "Danse Macabre (first performed in 1875) is the name of opus 40 by French composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\r\n\r\nThe composition is based upon a poem by Henri Cazalis, on an old French superstition:\r\n\r\n    Zig, zig, zig, Death in a cadence,\r\n    Striking with his heel a tomb,\r\n    Death at midnight plays a dance-tune,\r\n    Zig, zig, zig, on his violin.\r\n    The winter wind blows and the night is dark;\r\n    Moans are heard in the linden trees.\r\n    Through the gloom, white skeletons pass,\r\n    Running and leaping in their shrouds.\r\n    Zig, zig, zig, each one is frisking,\r\n    The bones of the dancers are heard to crack\u2014\r\n    But hist! of a sudden they quit the round,\r\n    They push forward, they fly; the cock has crowed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ancient superstition, \"Death\" appears at midnight every year on Halloween. Death has the power to call forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle (represented by a solo violin with its E-string tuned to an E-flat in an example of scordatura tuning). His skeletons dance for him until the first break of dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year.\r\n\r\nThe piece opens with a harp playing a single note, D, twelve times to signify the clock striking midnight, accompanied by soft chords from the string section. This then leads to the eerie E flat and A chords (also known as a tritone or the \"Devil's chord\") played by a solo violin, representing death on his fiddle. After which the main theme is heard on a solo flute and is followed by a descending scale on the solo violin. The rest of the orchestra, particularly the lower instruments of the string section, then joins in on the descending scale. The main theme and the scale is then heard throughout the various sections of the orchestra until it breaks to the solo violin and the harp playing the scale. The piece becomes more energetic and climaxes at this point; the full orchestra playing with strong dynamics.Towards the end of the piece, there is another violin solo, now modulating, which is then joined by the rest of the orchestra. The final section, a pianissimo, represents the dawn breaking and the skeletons returning to their graves.\r\n\r\nThe piece makes particular use of the xylophone in a particular theme to imitate the sounds of rattling bones. Saint-Sa\u00ebns uses a similar motif in the Fossils part of his Carnival of the Animals.\r\n[from Wikipedia]\r\n\r\n\r\nArtwork: Remedios Varo \"Les Feuilles Mortes\".\nPlayed by: National Philharmonic Orchestra\nConductor: Leopold Stokowski",
